# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. The company has requested a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Method and Analysis

Unsupervised machine learning allows analysis of large datasets when there is no known output. After preprocessing the data, clustering was used to group the cryptocurrencies. The data will not be presented in this report as there were 532 cryptocurrencies that were grouped.
